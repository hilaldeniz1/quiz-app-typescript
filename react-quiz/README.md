### QUIZ-APP

- This project has been designed for a small-scale quiz, and TypeScript has been used. Why did we use TypeScript?

- TypeScript is an advanced version of JavaScript that enhances code safety through its static typing system, allowing for the early detection of errors. Additionally, features such as support in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and automatic completion contribute to a more efficient development process. Type annotations and declarations improve code readability, facilitating maintenance. Its compatibility with JavaScript means that TypeScript can be seamlessly integrated into existing projects. In large projects, TypeScript provides better organization and security, offering developers an enhanced development experience.
